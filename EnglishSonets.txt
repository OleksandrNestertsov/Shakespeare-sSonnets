Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye 
That thou consumest thyself in single life? 
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die. 
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife; 
//sadness

The world will be thy widow and still weep 
That thou no form of thee hast left behind, 
When every private widow well may keep 
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
